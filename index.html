                <br>
                <br>
                <p>I was born in New York City and after spending 9 years living in the United States, moved with my family to Australia where I now call home. I spent the majority of my childhood playing rugby and was fortunate enough to represent Australia at the schoolboy level.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I have spent the last 5 years working as a chiropractor after having completed the 5 year university degrees. I am married and have a dog named Hank. I have been interested in technology from an early age.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Enjoy taking a look at the projects I have worked on.</p>
